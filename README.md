# Paint it Black 32

An application that gives Win32 apps a dark titlebar using hooks and `dwmSetAttribute`.

_This project is currently a work in progress, and does not yet have any facilities to make it work out of the box. Currently, you must compile this yourself with MinGW, then leave the driver program running in a console window._
